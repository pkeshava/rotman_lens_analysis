Info on this software suite.

rotman_lens_analysis.m is where the bulk of the heavy lifting is done. This is
where you design the lens based on input parameters. rotman_dev then calls a function,
HFSS scripter, in rotmanfunctions which creates a set of coordinates in rotmanHFSS.py
that can be run by HFSS. This is all a little segmented for now but perhaps we can improve.

RL_Design is a good reference found from the web. I'm basically trying to create my own version of this that I have a little extra influence on.

NOTE: I'm adding a thesis in the literature folder that is VERY helpful.
